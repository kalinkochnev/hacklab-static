        <p>
          Hacklab is a budding grassroots initiative to bring together the innovators, creators, and dreamers of UConn. We are the kind of people whose spirit and passion tug upon our hearts and minds to satisfy our need for learning, creation, community, and ultimately purpose. <br><br> We pride ourselves on our attitude towards life. We say "can" while others chant "cannot". We leave our cynicism at the door and welcome the possibilities. <br> <br> We build each other up through honesty and gratuitous embetterment of each other. Life is not a zero sum game. We aim to connect one another with the resources needed to succeed, inspire, and forge lifelong connections in the process. <br><br> Individually we are talented. <br> <br> Together we are unstoppable. Join us and be part of something extraordinary! <br><br> Go UConn!!!
