# get involved!
We are a young club so if you want to leave your mark at UConn, this is a fantastic opportunity to do so. We think that Hacklab can become essential to the UConn community and we need your help to make that happen.

We have more ideas than we have people to work on them. And if you have an idea that you think will improve the club and UConn as a whole, we are all ears.
