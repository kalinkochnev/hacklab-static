Hi, I'm Kalin.

If there's anything you should know about me, my life revolves around working on passion projects. I have been programming for the vast majority of my life, starting all the way back in elementary school. Eventually, I discovered the joy (and extreme frustration) of coding. 




I *really* enjoy programming with math.
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of Connecticut where I have focused on computer science fundamentals (data structures, systems programming, algorithms) as well as mathematics (Calculus 1-3, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Proofs), and finally electrical engineering ()

I'm currently a computer science student at UCONN

You have a really good start
take your ideas like, "what code" "passion project" "extreme frustrations of coding" and you can really run wild with those ideas

but also, Some people would like to know a little more about yourself personally - like hobbies, plans, background.
